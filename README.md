# SuperScout
This project was an effort to model a robotic response system to an emergency. In a situation such as a building
collapse, robots would receive a blueprint, enter a building, detect changes in the environment, look for people, and send video feedback back to a user.

The following variables were simulated in these ways: 

Robot: Arduino 

Blueprint: Text in Form of 2D Array 

Building: Wood With Boxes to Simulate Walls 

Detection of Environmental Changes/People: Infrared Communication 

Video Feedback: Serial Communication and Skype(not included) 

Method of Area Surveillance: Right Hand Rule Algorithm in C++ 

Movement: Wheel Encoders on Arduino Bots
